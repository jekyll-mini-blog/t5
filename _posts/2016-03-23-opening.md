In the opening remarks, I will discuss the beginnings of [Precision Medicine Initiative](https://www.nih.gov/precision-medicine-initiative-cohort-program), a bold new research effort to revolutionize how we improve health and treat disease. My main focus will be on the PMI's goal of creation of a voluntary national research cohort. 

NIH, in collaboration with other agencies and stakeholders, will launch a national, patient-powered research cohort of one million or more Americans who volunteer to participate in research. Participants will be involved in the design of the Initiative and will have the opportunity to contribute diverse sources of data—including medical records; profiles of the patient’s genes, metabolites, and microorganisms in and on the body; environmental and lifestyle data; patient-generated information; and personal device and sensor data. This ambitious project will leverage existing research and clinical networks and build on innovative research models that enable patients to be active participants and partners. The cohort will be broadly accessible to qualified researchers and will have the potential to inspire scientists from multiple disciplines to join the effort and apply their creative thinking to generate new insights.
